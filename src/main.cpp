    There is absolutely no reason for this to be 
    in C++.

    Basically, show a bunch of menus and 
    descripsions to navigate a map and manage an 
    inventory. Solve a few simple puzzles to move
    around and reach the end.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
// TODO: Make a title menu and DO NOT fix this in the linter until thats completely done.

std::cout << " "  << std::endl;



return 0;
}
